title: About
---

My name is Frédéric Wang, I am a French Computer Engineer working at
[Igalia](https://www.igalia.com/) and a free software
enthusiast. I am a contributor to the Mozilla, WebKit and Chromium projects
and have expertise in math layout (TeX, OpenType MATH and MathML).

I also hold a master degree in pure mathematics from the
[Pierre and Marie Curie University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_and_Marie_Curie_University).
Nowadays, I continue practicing mathematics as a hobby although I occasionally
use them to solve practical problems in my engineering work.
