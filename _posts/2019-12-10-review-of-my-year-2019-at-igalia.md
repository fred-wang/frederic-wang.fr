  <h2 id="co-owner-and-mentorship">Co-owner and mentorship</h2>

<p>In 2016, I was among the new software engineers who joined Igalia. Three years later I applied to become co-owner of the company and the legal paperwork was completed in April. As my colleague Andy explained <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2013/06/13/but-that-would-be-anarchy">on his blog</a>, this does not change a lot of things in practice because most of the decisions are taken within the assembly. However, I‚Äôm still very happy and proud of having achieved this step üòÑ</p>

<p>One of my new duty has been to be the ‚Äúmentor‚Äù of <a href="https://www.igalia.com/igalian/mshin">Miyoung Shin</a> since February and to help with her integration at Igalia. Shin has been instrumental in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7w4LvqlRU">Igalia‚Äôs project to improve Chromium‚Äôs Code Health</a> with an <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/owner:myid.shin%2540igalia.com">impressive number of ~500 commits</a>. You can watch the video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2PcAnZV5r8">her BlinkOn lightning talk</a> on YouTube. In addition to her excellent technical contribution she has also invested her energy in company‚Äôs life, helping with the organization of social activities during our <a href="https://www.igalia.com/2018/06/04/The-23rd-biannual-Igalia-Summit.html">summits</a>, something which has really been appreciated by her colleagues. I‚Äôm really glad that she has recently entered the assembly and will be able to
take a more active role in the company‚Äôs decisions!</p>

<h2 id="working-with-new-colleagues">Working with new colleagues</h2>

<p>Igalia also hired
<a href="https://frederic-wang.fr/review-of-igalia-s-web-platform-activities-H2-2018.html">Cathie Chen</a> last December and I‚Äôve gotten the chance to work with her as part of our Web Platform collaboration with AMP. Cathie has been very productive and we have been able to push forward several features, mostly related to scrolling. Additionally, she implemented <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver">ResizeObserver</a> in WebKit, which is a quite exciting new feature for web developers!</p>

<p>The other project I‚Äôve been contributed to this year is
<a href="https://mathml.igalia.com/">MathML</a>. We are introducing new
math and font concepts into Chromium‚Äôs new layout engine, so the project is
both technically challenging and fascinating. For this project,
I was able to rely on
<a href="https://www.igalia.com/igalian/rbuis">Rob</a>‚Äôs excellent development skills
to complete <a href="https://mathml.igalia.com/news/2019/07/25/project-status-after-one-semester/#new">this year‚Äôs implementation roadmap</a> on our Chromium branch
and start <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/hashtag:%22mathml%22">upstreaming patches</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, <a href="https://mathml.igalia.com/news/2019/10/31/mathml-in-chromium-upstream-process-started">a lot of extra non-implementation effort</a> has been done which led to consensus
between browser implementers, MathML enthusiasts and other web developer groups.
<a href="https://bkardell.com/">Brian Kardell</a>
became a developer advocate for Igalia in March
and has been very helpful talking to different people, explaining our project
and introducing ideas from the Extensible Web, HTML or CSS Communities. I strongly
recommend his
recent <a href="https://mathml.igalia.com/news/2019/12/03/igalia-chats-with-neil-soiffer-on-mathml/#new">Igalia chat</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uajCY9rGqfw">lightning talk</a> for a good
explanation of what we have been doing this year.</p>

<h2 id="conferences">Conferences</h2>

<p>These are the developer conferences I attended this year and gave talks
about our MathML project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>April (Toronto): <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/HxTVkDgXDWw/jCSkQlsCBwAJ">BlinkOn 10</a> - <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/igalia/mathml-in-layoutng-blinkon-10">talk</a></li>
  <li>October (A Coru√±a): <a href="https://webengineshackfest.org/2019/">Web Engines Hackfest 2019</a> - <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/igalia/mathml-in-browsers-web-engines-hackfest-2019">talk</a>&amp;<a href="https://youtu.be/Q8Z1D2i61j8?list=PL4sEzdAGvRgDCN6qACHWs04mQQTWBkdGq">video</a></li>
  <li>November (Sunnyvalle): <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/O01tTGsI9xc/pBo12Qa2EQAJ">BlinkOn 11</a> - <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/igalia/mathml-core">talk</a></li>

<p>As usual it was nice to meet the web platform and chromium communities during
these events and to hear about the great projects happening. I‚Äôm also super
excited that the assembly decided to
<a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2019/12/05/web-engines-hackfest-2020-new-dates-new-venue/">try something new for my favorite event</a>.
Indeed, next year we will organize the Web Engines Hackfest in May to avoid
conflicts with other browser events but more importantly, we will move to
a bigger venue so that we can welcome more people. I‚Äôm really looking forward
to seeing how things go!</p>

<h2 id="paris---a-coru√±a-by-train">Paris - A Coru√±a by train</h2>

<p>Environmental protection is an important topic discussed in our cooperative.
This year, I‚Äôve tried to reduce my carbon footprint when traveling to
Igalia‚Äôs headquarters by using train instead of plane. Obviously the latter
is faster but the former is much more confortable and has less security
constraints.
It is possible to use high-speed train from Paris to Barcelona and then a
Trenhotel to avoid a hotel night. For a quantitative comparison,
let‚Äôs consider this table, based on my personal travel experience:</p>

<table style="padding: 1em; width: 100%">
<tr>
  <th>Traject</th>
  <th>Transport</th>
  <th>Duration</th>
  <th>Price</th>
  <th>CO2/passenger</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Paris - Barcelona</td>
  <td>TGV</td>
  <td>~6h30</td>
  <td>60-90‚Ç¨</td>
  <td>6kg</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Barcelona - A Coru√±a</td>
  <td>Trenhotel</td>
  <td>~15h</td>
  <td>40-60‚Ç¨</td>
  <td>Unspecified</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Paris - A Coru√±a<br />(via Madrid)</td>
  <td>Iberia</td>
  <td>4h30-5h</td>
  <td>100-150‚Ç¨</td>
  <td>192kg</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The price depends on how early the tickets are booked but it is more or less the
same for train and plane.
Renfe does not seem to indicate estimated CO2 emission and trains to Galicia are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenhotel#Traction">probably not the most eco-friendly</a>. However, using this <a href="https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=6">online estimator</a>, the 1200 kilometers
between Barcelona and A Coru√±a
would emit 50kg by national train. This would mean a reduction of 71% in the
emission of CO2, which is quite significant. Hopefully things will get better
when one day
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVE">AVE</a> is available between Madrid and
A Coru√±a‚Ä¶ üòâ</p>
