  <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>At Igalia, we attend many browser events. This is a quick summary of some
recents conferences I participated toâ€¦ or that gave me the opportunity to meet
Igalians in Paris ðŸ˜‰.</p>

<h2 id="week-31-paris---css-wg-f2f---w3c">Week 31: Paris - CSS WG F2F - W3C</h2>

<p>My teammate <a href="https://www.igalia.com/igalia-247/igalian/item/svillar/">Sergio</a> attended the <a href="https://wiki.csswg.org/planning/paris-2017">CSS WG F2F meeting</a> as an observer. On Tuesday morning, I also made an appearance
(but it was so brief that
<a href="https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Une_saison_en_enfer">ceux que jâ€™ai rencontrÃ©s ne mâ€™ont peut-Ãªtre pas vu</a>).
Together with other browser vendors and WG members,
Sergio gave an interview regarding <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/the-story-of-css-grid-from-its-creators">the successful story of CSS Grid Layout</a>.
By the way, given our
implementation work in WebKit and Blink, Igalia finally decided
to <a href="https://twitter.com/regocas/status/908604005999357952">join the CSS Working Group</a> ðŸ˜Š.
Of course, during that week I had dinner with
Sergio and it was nice to chat with my colleague in a French restaurant
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montmartre">Montmartre</a>.</p>

<h2 id="week-38-tokyo---blinkon-8---google">Week 38: Tokyo - BlinkOn 8 - Google</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.igalia.com/igalia-247/igalian/item/jaragunde/">Jacobo</a>,
<a href="https://www.igalia.com/igalia-247/igalian/item/gkim/">Gyuyoung</a> and I
attended <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ioqAuyl6UK7Z0HHswBM5JgAp-izn_3S">BlinkOn 8</a>. I had nice discussions and listened to
interesting talks about a wide range of topics (Layout NG,
Accessibility, CSS, Fonts,
Web Predictability &amp; Standards, etc). It was a pleasure to finally meet in persons
some developers I had been in touch with during my projects on
<a href="https://github.com/Igalia/chromium#chromium-for-wayland">Ozone/Wayland</a> and
WebKit/iOS.
For the lightning talks, we presented our activities
on <a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/jaragunde/files/2017/09/chromium-on-embedded-linux.pdf">embedded linux platforms</a> and the <a href="https://people.igalia.com/fwang/blink-on-8/lightning-talk-frederic-wang-igalia-contribution-to-the-web-platform.pdf">Web Platform</a>. Incidentally, it was great to see Igaliaâ€™s work
mentioned during the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11rr_vo7UNS6icihnWZMx45O4y5JiSegZKYLQKA1LAdo/present">Next Generation Rendering Engine session</a>.
Obviously, I had the opportunity to visit places and taste Japanese food in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asakusa">Asakusa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ueno">Ueno</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roppongi">Roppongi</a> ðŸ˜‹.</p>

<h2 id="week-40-a-coruÃ±a---web-engines-hackfest---igalia">Week 40: A CoruÃ±a - Web Engines Hackfest - Igalia</h2>

<p>I attended
<a href="https://webengineshackfest.org/">one of my favorite events</a>, that gathers
the whole browser community during three days for
<a href="https://github.com/Igalia/webengineshackfest/wiki#web-engines-hackfest-2017">technical presentations, breakout sessions, hacking and galician food</a>. This year, we had many
<a href="https://webengineshackfest.org/#sponsors">sponsors</a>
and attendees. It is good to see that the event is becoming more
and more popular! It was long overdue, but I was finally able to make
<a href="https://github.com/google/brotli">Brotli</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/google/woff2">WOFF2</a> installable as system libraries
on Linux and usable by WebKitGTK+ ðŸ˜Š. I opened <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1405703">similar</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1405704">bugs</a> in Gecko and the same could be done in Chromium. Among the things I enjoyed,
I met <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/jfkthame">Jonathan Kew</a> in person and heard more about <a href="https://www.igalia.com/igalia-247/igalian/item/agomes/">Antonio</a> and <a href="https://www.igalia.com/igalia-247/igalian/item/msisov/">Maksim</a>â€™s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efmYPFHnaSM">progress on Ozone/Wayland</a>.
As usual, it was nice to share time with colleagues, attend the assembly meeting,
play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">football</a> matches, have meals, visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturias">Asturias</a>â€¦ and tell oneâ€™s story ðŸ˜‰.</p>

<h2 id="week-41-san-jose---webkit-contributors-meeting---apple">Week 41: <del>San Jose - WebKit Contributors Meeting - Apple</del></h2>

<p>In the past months, I have mostly been working on WebKit at Igalia and
I would have been happy to see my fellow WebKit developers.
However, given the events in Japan and Spain, I was not willing to make another
trip to the USA just after. Hence I had to miss the
WebKit Contributors Meeting again this year ðŸ˜ž.
Fortunately,
my colleagues <a href="https://www.igalia.com/igalia-247/igalian/item/alex/">Alex</a>,
<a href="https://www.igalia.com/igalia-247/igalian/item/mcatanzaro/">Michael</a> and
<a href="https://www.igalia.com/igalia-247/igalian/item/zdobersek/">Å½an</a>
were present. Igalia is an important contributor
to WebKit and we will continue to send people and propose some talks next year.</p>

<h2 id="week-42-paris---monthly-speaker-series---mozilla">Week 42: Paris - Monthly Speaker Series - Mozilla</h2>

<p>This Wednesday, I attended a conference on
<a href="https://air.mozilla.org/privacy-as-a-competitive-advantage-with-gry-hasselbalch/">Privacy as a Competitive Advantage</a> in Mozillaâ€™s office. It was
nice
to hear about the increasing interest on privacy and to see the
regulation made by the European Union in that direction.
My colleague <a href="https://www.igalia.com/igalia-247/igalian/item/pnormand/">Philippe</a> was visiting the office
to work with some Mozilla developers on one of our project, so I was also able
to meet him in the conference room. Actually, Mozilla employees were kind enough
to let me stay at the office after the conferenceâ€¦ Hence I was able to work on Appleâ€™s Web Engine on a <a href="https://frederic-wang.fr/amp-and-igalia-working-together-to-improve-the-web-platform.html">project sponsored by Google</a> at the Mozilla officeâ€¦ probably something you can only do at Igalia ðŸ˜‰. Last but not least, <a href="https://www.igalia.com/igalia-247/igalian/item/gemont/">Guillaume</a> was also in holidays in Paris this week, so I let you imagine
what happens when three French guys meet (hint: it involves food ðŸ˜‹).</p>
